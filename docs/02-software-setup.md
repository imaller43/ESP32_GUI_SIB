# 02 — Software Setup

This guide covers everything from installing Arduino IDE to getting the dashboard live in your browser.

---

## Step 1 — Install Arduino IDE

Download **Arduino IDE 2.x** from [arduino.cc/en/software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and run the installer with default settings.

---

## Step 2 — Add the ESP32 Board Package

1. Open Arduino IDE → **File → Preferences**
2. Paste the following URL into *Additional boards manager URLs*:
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
   ```
3. Click **OK**
4. Go to **Tools → Board → Boards Manager**, search for `esp32` by *Espressif Systems*, and click **Install**

---

## Step 3 — Select the Board and Settings

1. **Tools → Board → ESP32 Arduino** → select `Waveshare ESP32-S3-Zero`
2. **Tools → Partition Scheme** → select `Default 4MB with spiffs (1.2MB APP/1.5MB SPIFFS)` or any scheme with at least 1 MB for LittleFS and support OTA.
3. **Tools → Port** → select the COM port that appears when the board is plugged in via USB-C

---

## Step 4 — Install Required Libraries

Go to **Tools → Manage Libraries** and install each of these:

| Library | Author |
|---|---|
| `PubSubClient` | Nick O'Leary |
| `arduinoWebSockets` | Links2004 |
| `ModbusMaster` | 4-20mA |
| `ArduinoJson` | Benoit Blanchon — install **v6.x** (not v7) |
| `UniversalTelegramBot` | Brian Lough |

The remaining libraries (`LittleFS`, `SD_MMC`, `ETH`, `WebServer`, `WiFiClientSecure`) are bundled with the ESP32 Arduino core — no separate install needed.

---

## Step 5 — Install the LittleFS Upload Plugin (For Arduino IDE 2.x)

The web files (HTML, CSS, JSON) are stored in the ESP32's flash and must be uploaded separately from the firmware using an extension.

1. Download the latest `.vsix` file from the official releases page:
   [github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-littlefs-upload/releases](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-littlefs-upload/releases)
2. Copy the downloaded `.vsix` file to the Arduino IDE plugins directory:
   - **Windows:** `C:\Users\<username>\.arduinoIDE\plugins\`
   - **macOS / Linux:** `~/.arduinoIDE/plugins/`
   
   *(Note: You may need to create the `plugins` directory yourself beforehand if it does not exist).*
3. **Restart the Arduino IDE completely.**
4. **Verify:** Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + P` (macOS), search for `Upload LittleFS` — the option **"Upload LittleFS to Pico/ESP8266/ESP32"** should now appear in the list.
---

## Step 6 — Set Your Wi-Fi Credentials

Open `ESP32_GUI.ino` and update these two lines near the top:

```cpp
const char* ssid     = "YOUR_SSID";
const char* password = "YOUR_PASSWORD";
```

> If you are always using Ethernet, Wi-Fi is only used as a fallback — but you still need valid credentials in case Ethernet is unavailable.

---

## Step 7 — Upload the Firmware

1. Connect the board via USB-C
2. Confirm the correct board and COM port are selected under the **Tools** menu
3. Click **Upload** (the arrow button) or press `Ctrl+U`
4. Wait for *Done uploading* in the output panel

---

## Step 8 — Upload the Web Files (LittleFS)

> **Close the Serial Monitor** before this step — it locks the COM port and the upload will fail.

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` in Arduino IDE
2. Search for and run **Upload LittleFS**
3. Wait for *LittleFS Image Uploaded* in the output panel

The entire `data/` folder is now stored in the ESP32's internal flash.

> Firmware upload and LittleFS upload are **two separate operations**. Both must be done on first setup. After that, if you only change `.html` or `.css` files, you only need to repeat the LittleFS upload. If you only change firmware code, you only need to repeat the firmware upload.

---

## Step 9 — Find the IP Address

1. Open **Tools → Serial Monitor** and set the baud rate to **115200**
2. Press the **RESET** button on the board (or unplug and replug USB)
3. Look for a line like:
   ```
   ETH IP: 192.168.1.105
   ```
   or
   ```
   WiFi IP: 192.168.1.105
   ```
4. Note that IP address — you can also find it on your router's connected devices list

---

## Step 10 — Open the Dashboard

1. Make sure your PC or phone is on the **same network** as the ESP32
2. Open a browser and go to `http://<IP>` — for example `http://192.168.1.105`
3. You will be redirected to the login page automatically
4. Log in with: **admin** / **admin123**

The dashboard loads showing live DI/DO states, machine metrics, and ESP32 health.
